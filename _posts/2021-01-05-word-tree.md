Keeping this one short, as it was one of the case studies from the [textbook](https://bradfieldcs.com/algos/graphs/word-ladder/), so pretty easy to solve after having read about it.

# Problem
Word Ladder

Given a dictionary of valid words, a start word, and a target word, return the minimum number of transformations to get from the start word to the target word.
Return -1 if it’s not possible. A transformation can change a single letter at a time. Example: hat->pig, [hit, pit, pig] could be hat->hit->pit->pig, which is 3 transformations.

Input:
```
beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
```

Output:
```
5
```


# Solution

I can model this as a graph problem and that "minimum" is a dead giveaway that I want to use breadth-first search.
Nodes in the tree are words and each has an edge to other words that are a single transformation away.
There’s some legwork to group similar words together but overall the solution is a plain BFS.

First, the legwork:

```python
from itertools import product
from collections import defaultdict

sub_matches = defaultdict(list)
for word in word_list:
    for i in range(len(word)):
    entry = word[0:i] + "_" + word[i + 1:]
    sub_matches[entry].append(word)

for _, matches in sub_matches.items():
    for word_one, word_two in product(matches, repeat=2):
        if word_one != word_two:
            graph[word_one].append(word_two)
            graph[word_two].append(word_one)
```

First, this builds a structure like this:

```python
{
  "_it": ["hit"],
  "hi_": ["hit"],
  "_ot": ["hot", "dot", "lot"],
  "h_t": ["hot", "hit"],
  "ho_": ["hot"],
  "d_t": ["dot"],
  "do_": ["dot", "dog"],
  "l_t": ["lot"],
  "lo_": ["lot", "log"],
  "_og": ["dog", "log", "cog"],
  "d_g": ["dog"],
  "_ot": ["lot"],
  "c_g": ["cog"],
  "co_": ["cog"]
}
```

This is just to make the matching between similar words easy. From there, I build the graph we actually care about:

```python
# beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
{
  "hit": ["hot"],
  "hot": ["hit", "dot", "lot"],
  "dot": ["dog", "lot", "hot"],
  "dog": ["dot", "log", "cog"],
  "lot": ["log", "hot", "dot"],
  "cog": ["dog", "log"]
}
```

Using this graph, perform a breadth-first search, building a `paths` data structure of all words and the nodes we visited on the way to them.

```python
def bfs(self, graph, start):
    queue = deque([start])
    seen = set()
    paths = defaultdict(list)
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        neighbors = graph[node]
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if neighbor not in seen:
              queue.append(neighbor)
              paths[neighbor] += paths[node]
              paths[neighbor].append(node)
              seen.add(neighbor)
    return paths
```

Here's the full solution:

```python
from itertools import product
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, begin_word, end_word, word_list):
        sub_matches = defaultdict(list)
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        word_list.append(begin_word)
        for word in word_list:
          for i in range(len(word)):
            entry = word[0:i] + "_" + word[i + 1:]
            sub_matches[entry].append(word)

        for _, matches in sub_matches.items():
          for word_one, word_two in product(matches, repeat=2):
            if word_one != word_two:
                graph[word_one].append(word_two)
                graph[word_two].append(word_one)

        paths = self.bfs(graph, begin_word)
        if paths[end_word]:
            return len(paths[end_word]) + 1
        return 0

    def bfs(self, graph, start):
        queue = deque([start])
        seen = set()
        paths = defaultdict(list)
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            neighbors = graph[node]
            for neighbor in neighbors:
                if neighbor not in seen:
                  queue.append(neighbor)
                  paths[neighbor] += paths[node]
                  paths[neighbor].append(node)
                  seen.add(neighbor)
        return paths
```
