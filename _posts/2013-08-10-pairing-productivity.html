On Thursday, <a href="http://emptyingtheteacup.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Nhu</a> and I paired on a <a href="https://github.com/arlandism/n-body" target="_blank">Clojure math/physics project</a> I've been working on. It turned out really well and really helped me understand the benefits of <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html" target="_blank">pairing</a>.<br /><br />Nhu had absolutely no knowledge of the problem domain before we started, but she did know Clojure so we were off to a good start. After a few minutes of explaining the details of what I was trying to accomplish, we started working.<br /><br />I'd write a test and together we would come up with a solution and then try to refactor it. She would devise a test, and again we'd start trying to unravel the algorithm. The refactoring was fierce: "I don't like that name, let's change it." "That's the wrong kind of test, let's think of another." The experience was extremely enlightening! We were catching each other's mistakes, explaining nuances of the Clojure language and of the problem domain to each other, and learning tons along the way.<br /><br />Prior to this experience, I sometimes questioned the value of pairing on a problem. It seemed like two programmers just sat at a computer and watched each other type. One programmer would have more knowledge or experience than the other, and the second participant would spiritlessly watch the veteran; contributing tidbits here and there. This hardly seemed like the ideal scenario for productivity, much less one of the cornerstones of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile Movement</a>. Thursday really hit the lesson home for me. Pairing is about learning in every way you can. How does your pair partner navigate their text editor/IDE? What kinds of naming conventions do they use? Is their code more expressive than yours? Do you and your partner agree on the tests you're writing? You're very exposed and vulnerable while pairing, but it builds you up to take criticism well, contrast your habits to others, and pick up better habits from your partner.<br /><br />I learned a lot through this pairing experience, not just about Clojure, or about math, but about programming and collaboration in general.
