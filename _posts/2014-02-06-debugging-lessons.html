Today, Wai Lee and I got derailed on our main feature because of issues in production. While I found the experience somewhat "painful" - it was tedious and unnerving, it was also a good lesson in methodical debugging.<br /><br /><b>Background</b><br /><br />The most complicated part of the application is the integration with third-party services. Basically, we have these two data sources and when a user triggers a certain action we query the data sources to combine them and build an accurate model of the data. This model then gets dumped into a viewing area for users.Well, we had some beta-testers playing with the app today and the data didn't look the way it was supposed to.<br /><br /><b>Debugging</b><br /><b><br /></b>Kelly and Wai Lee knocked out an awesome feature last week that proved invaluable today: server logging. We were able to ssh into the production server and look at the logs to see what happened. You can probably imagine that this was pretty messy so we did our best to find snapshots of the data that we could examine locally. After some fumbling, we got the data and began playing with it. After determining that we weren't parsing the data incorrectly, Wai Lee came up with a theory that one of the data sources wasn't sending us data when we expected it to. We went off that hypothesis and it turned out to be right on the money.<br /><br /><b>Takeaways</b><br /><b><br /></b>I've been through my fair share of debugging sessions and I've often come away with nothing useful. I think this session taught me some valuable steps to take in the debugging process:<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>Remain Calm. It's always tough to get bug reports but it always seems like they come at the worst times. Personally, I'll be hunting for a bug and be so stressed out about it that I begin to second-guess myself and form illogical conclusions about what I'm seeing. Our approach today was very deliberate and disciplined. We took things slow and thought hard about the expected behavior of the application vs the behavior we were seeing.</li><li>Form a Plan. Maybe this ties in with being stressed out but I'm not sure I would've thought to cherry-pick pieces of the log data to examine. Most likely, I would've stared at the whole blob and tried to find a pattern. We didn't formally discuss a plan but I got the impression that Wai Lee's been through this so much that it was intuitive for him.&nbsp;</li><li>Follow the Scientific Method. We formed hypotheses and set out to experiment with them and made sure not to pollute our experiments by including theories from multiple hypotheses. In the moment, this feels risky; your hypothesis could be completely wrong so you're afraid that going down one rabbit hole could be a huge waste of time. Still, choosing one path to follow is a good idea, if only to rule it out.&nbsp;</li></ul>
