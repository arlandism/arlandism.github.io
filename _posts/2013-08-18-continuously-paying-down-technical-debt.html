Ward Cunningham has a great post on technical debt <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TechnicalDebt" target="_blank">here</a>. In simple terms, technical debt is the accrued interest on deferred decisions. It starts out with simple things like "I'll get around to refactoring this tomorrow". Eventually, you end up with tons of classes that should've been refactored. Technical debt doesn't just apply to refactoring though. It encompasses all decisions about your code that you have decided aren't priority number one - that goes for style conventions, variable naming, refactorings, version control commits, etc.<br /><br />This technical debt has to get paid somewhere, by someone, down the line. That someone could be you, or the poor soul that has to take on the project after you. But, someone will pay the piper!<br /><br />In the Agile process, paying down technical debt is believed to be vital. So vital in fact, that refactorings should occur every time all of your tests are passing. This is akin to paying down your financial debt with your excess change whenever you make a transaction. While these pennies may seem insignificant, they eventually culminate in a large pay-off. While it's doubtful that any large project is completely exempt from technical debt, the best pay off the interest little by little.<br /><br />Jeff Atwood has great advice on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/02/paying-down-your-technical-debt.html" target="_blank">paying down technical debt</a>.
