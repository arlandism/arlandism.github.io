Working on a project with "real" deadlines has serious ramifications on where development time is being invested. With that in mind, it's startling to me how little time is spent solving actual problems and implementing features. The biggest consumers of time I've seen are:<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>Debugging: Obviously, this takes up a huge chunk of time. Where'd this error come from? What does this data structure look like at this point in execution? Luckily, my debugging skills have improved a great deal; it's really just narrowing down the problem area and checking the data. My current debugging strategy is the classic 'print-everything' technique. Would learning a debugger be time well-spent?&nbsp;</li><li>Editing/Formatting: This varies with the toolset I'm using. I'm most comfortable and productive in Vim, seamlessly applying complex transformations. Put me in Sublime and I'm completely useless. I may as well be writing code by hand. Meditating on this made me realize how coupled I am to my toolset. It would probably be a good idea to expand my editing horizons.</li><li>Pulling/Merging/Rebasing: I've learned more about Git in the last two weeks than I have over the entire span of my apprenticeship. But, I'm still not completely comfortable in some areas; it took me a long time to understand rebasing. Last week, I got out of sync with our master branch and experienced an extremely painful and time-consuming rebase. I think improvement in this area comes from a better Git workflow (e.g. cleaner commits, staying in-sync with master, etc.)</li><li>Code Review/Improvement: There's really no way around this, except to write better code so less time is spent trying to improve it later. We also spend a significant amount of time reviewing pull requests. For me, this is more of an exercise is learning to work on team projects than it is on reviewing good code since everyone else on the team has already attained craftsman status so there's an implicit understanding that their code is better than mine.&nbsp;</li><li>Meetings/Standups/Demos: Demos and meetings are the real killer here; standups don't take very long. This seems like another area that would be hard to improve upon, unless the team set some kind of meeting guidelines to reduce cruft.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Keeping those things in mind, it seems like the best developers probably find ways to shave unproductive time. At the end of the day we want to ship products, but these areas are necessary to facilitate that goal. Personally, I hope to improve in the areas I can to lower future estimates and spend more time writing code.</div>
