Acceptance testing is the process of writing non-techie legible tests that demonstrate client-specified functionality. Cucumber is a testing framework that allows you write higher-level tests for your system.<br /><br />For example, in conjunction with Capybara or WebRat, I can simulate button-clicking on my web user-interface and make assertions about what should appear on the page. This is really cool stuff, but it makes me wonder if it's really worth the overhead incurred.<br /><br />Rspec is a pretty powerful testing framework. Good Rspec tests even sound English-like. And Rspec can be integrated with &nbsp;Capybara or WebRat, enabling the ability to test through the browser in the same manner I mentioned above.<br /><br /><b>Cucumber Overhead</b><br /><b><br /></b>Cucumber is fairly lightweight. Essentially, you create a features directory along with some .feature files to write the acceptance tests. Then, you can create what are called "steps" to actually execute the Ruby code running behind the acceptance tests. Though the learning curve isn't very steep, it's still there. To use Cucumber, you have to learn the .feature syntax. To effectively make use of the "steps" you either have to be fairly familiar with regex or plan to spend a lot of time copying and pasting from the Cucumber prompts that tell you how to code your "steps". I think Cucumber does some powerful work with very minimal overhead, but if Rspec can do essentially the same thing then I'm not certain the benefits outweigh the decreased productivity while learning to use Cucumber.<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><br />From what I've read, it seems like Cucumber was built specifically with acceptance tests in mind. While Rspec, strapped with some good browser interaction libraries, can accomplish the same tasks, it's more widely used for its unit-testing capabilities. &nbsp;Still, I've heard of people preferring to use Rspec over Cucumber for acceptance tests.<br /><br />Cucumber has pretty widespread support in the Agile community, so I'm not sure if I have the audacity to question its usefulness. I think that once I become accustomed to its features and have to use it in "real-life" then I'll start to appreciate it more.<br /><br /><br />
