I'm a "self-taught" programmer so I run into a lot of imposter syndrome when reading blog posts that touch areas I've never had exposure to. So, I'm making a list of computer science areas that I want to tackle in the next few months in the hopes that it'll provide sufficient motivation to actually get through the list.

- Most/all topics in [this book](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf) and the corresponding [lecture series](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/).
- Algorithm material typically covered in a top-tier comp sci undergrad program.
- Ditto above for programming languages and compilers.
- Ditto above for operating systems.
- C - not a 'comp sci' topic, but it's always been on my list.

This is a super ambitious list when trying to balance my other hobbies and full-time job. I also have a bad track record when it comes to completing learning challenges like this. To combat this, I'm going to try to keep a moderate pace so that the learning aspect remains fun. Plus, I'm hoping to take some tips from Scott Young's [MIT challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/).
