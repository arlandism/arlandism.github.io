I've started reading Uncle Bob Martin's "<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a></i>" and, as my first exposure to the intricacies of professional software development, it is quite the read. I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I grabbed it from the 8th Light bookshelf, but already I'm feeling like the book is having a strong impact on the way I think about programming. Thus far, I've read the first three chapters dealing with introduction, conceptualizing meaningful variable names, and functions, respectively. I'll highlight a couple of the best points/habits I've picked up from the book so far.<br /><br /><b>Clean Code Varies By Developer</b><br />Currently, there's no real standard on what "clean code" is. Uncle Bob outlines his thoughts on the matters and gives the reader a glimpse of what a few legendary software veterans, including Dave Thomas, Bjarne Stroustrup, among others, have to say on the subject. While there was some difference in opinion on the details, the consensus I noticed about what clean code follows here: elegant, concise, well cared for, explicit, specific, and easy-to-read. This gives the reader a great framework about what "clean code" may look like, and how one can begin noticing it. One of the real highlights of the chapter is when Uncle Bob notes that, often, "clean code" won't be recognized unless you're actively seeking it. The essence of "clean code" is that it's hard to write, and it's so good that you won't notice how good it is at first glance. As the artist paints beautiful canvasses layered with intricacy by seemingly simple brushstrokes, so it is with the best "clean code" authors.<br /><br /><b>Variable/Parameter Names Are a Big Deal</b><br />We've all fallen prey to it. Giving that function parameter some frivolous name because the one you thought of turns out to be a built-in method. Uncle Bob makes mention of this temptation, and warns against the sour fruit such sowing may yield. Names could be the difference between merely comprehending your code, and being able to understand it on an intuitive level. Throughout the book, Uncle Bob takes code samples, from real projects, and refactors them into a telling narrative. This is a common theme in the early chapters; the code as a narrative metaphor is discussed more than once.<br /><br /><b>Functions Should Do ONE Thing</b><br />Chapter 3 regarding functions is probably the most important takeaway from the book thus far. Functions are the real meat-and-potatoes of the code, so devoting an entire chapter to them certainly makes sense. The vital piece of information I extracted from this chapter is that functions should only try to do one thing. Side effects are bad and should be avoided. Ideally, a function should take no arguments, and at most should only take three. Any more than that probably means that you should encapsulate some of the functionality into another function. One level of abstraction per function is mentioned as a good practice.<br /><br />Overall, I'm enjoying the book and applying its principles to my code. It's a great read and I hope to learn even more from it.
