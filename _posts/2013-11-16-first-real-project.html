I got moved to work on 8th Light's dojo-dashboard project this week. It's a dynamic web page that we keep open on one of the displays in the office. The front-end is Clojurescript and Hiccup, while the backend is Clojure. The backend just does a bunch of API calls and hands the data off to the front-end.<br /><br />I was put on this project to interact with our stakeholder (Micah) as if he were a real client. This means deliverables are important and commitments are, well, commitments.<br /><br />Phil and I got started by trying to estimate some of the stories already on the backlog, getting more details about the acceptance criteria along the way. Initially, we had what we thought were pretty good estimates, but then we started talking to former team members and they were skeptical about our optimism. So, after doing a quick spike and talking about it some more, we re-estimated.<br /><br />It's pretty scary estimating on a project that you haven't even touched yet. You don't know what the codebase is like or what could go wrong. One great thing about the project is that it's relatively small, so understanding the codebase shouldn't be difficult. Getting acclimated to front-end development is a different story, as I've done very little with Javascript and the DOM.<br /><br />I'm pretty excited and nervous about the project. It feels great to be working on something with tangible benefits and a "real" client. It's scary because if I blow my estimates and something's not done then it decomposes the client relationship. Phil and I are hoping to get familiar with the codebase this first week and build up momentum for next week's stories.
