Today, I worked on some CRUD operations for a client project. The app is pretty well-structured, so it was mostly a matter of getting my bearings and figuring out how to wire up the various operations. The morning was really slow since it was just spent reading code, which upset me because I wasn't contributing as much as I wanted. Later in the day, Wai Lee and I paired on the story and got quite a bit done.<br /><br />The whole team worked from home so there were some communication barriers that needed to be overcome, but it went smoothly for the most part.<br /><br />On the downside, we were recently forced into switching over from our database implementation because of some join-table issues. The app is structured in a way that the switch over doesn't ripple through the project too much, but it has been a setback on the overall iteration.<br /><br />The primary issues I faced today were getting acclimated to the project's standards and conventions, figuring out and understanding how the relevant parts of the codebase worked, and trying to make sense out of the somewhat complex technical discussions going on in the team.
