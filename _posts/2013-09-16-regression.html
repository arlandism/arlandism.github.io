I had my weekly iteration product meeting today and it gave me some great insight into why software craftsmanship is so hard.<br /><br />Progressively, my feature work has gotten more difficult. Every week, I get a project that requires me to either extend my current design or learn some new technology. This week, I managed to get what I consider a rather cool, and somewhat difficult, feature completed. Because of this success, I was confident that my weekly meeting would end in a "good job, keep it up" sort of way. Instead, I was made aware of some amateurish mistakes I had made. Weird and non-comprehensive tests, and bad method/class names were amongst the items on the need-to-be-improved chopping block. These are all things that have been pointed out before, yet here they are happening again. I'm not one to forget important things very easily, so I found myself meditating on why errors like these were reappearing in my code. This introspection is what led to my world-shattering revelation: designing software is hard!<br /><br />Cue the shocked-faces and dropped jaws. More specifically, designing well-crafted software is hard. I realized that the reason these spectral oversights had reemerged was because of the higher-level implementation that my brain was focused on. When you're constantly staring at the big picture, it's hard to get the minutiae right. If I'm working really hard to test-drive a new design, I may be more lax about a few variable names; I can always change them later, right? If my energy is being devoted to learning a new language, I may neglect the canonical idioms used in the language. This negligence in the face of difficulty is unacceptable and is what makes good software design so difficult.<br /><br />I hope to rid myself of these poor habits by constantly reminding myself of the need to break them and the rewards that follow. In his books, Uncle Bob often speaks of these kinds of habits as the ones that ultimately lead to software failure. Discipline is one of the driving forces behind craftsmanship.
