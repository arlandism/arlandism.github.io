Today, 8th Light hosted a great talk from <a href="http://blakesmith.me/" target="_blank">Blake Smith</a>&nbsp;about the programming language Go created by Google. While some of the aspects of the talk were a bit over my head (i.e. concurrency), there were some parts where I could grasp what Blake was trying to show us. Here's what I took away:<br /><br /><b>Go is Fast</b><br />Blake commented that he thinks the popularity of dynamic languages is due in part to the speed at which they can be run. The immediate feedback loop that you get with a dynamic language is often much preferable to the process you have to go through when using compiled languages. One of the major benefits of Go is that it's compiler was built to be optimized for speed. In the demonstrations, Blake would run "go run foo.go" and the program would compile and run instantly. With that kind of speed Go's feedback loop is very comparable to a dynamic language.<br /><br /><b>Go is Good For a Variety of Tasks</b><br />Another huge takeaway from the talk was that Go is pretty versatile. It's an imperative language, but has struct concepts similar to C that give it a bit of an object feel. There was also a point in the talk where Blake called a function like bar.foo which seemed very object-like. Google built Go for managing their huge data loads on their servers, so speed and scaling are key advantages to the language. Go also handles concurrency pretty well. While Blake mentioned that there were no built-in checks to prevent you from doing some damage if you're inexperienced in concurrency, he also touted the simplicity which would you could do concurrent programming in Go. This was the part of the talk that was a bit out of my league but he did mention that concurrent programming is done through some kind of "channel" mechanism.<br /><br />To give us a sample of what the language could do, Blake demonstrated a simple gif server that he built. A user could upload an image and the server would take the raw bytes from the image, convert them to a buffer object, take a "snapshot" to implement a thumbnail, and send them to the server. He had the server hosted on his website and we got a live demo of it in action. It was pretty cool!<br /><br /><b>Nice Standard Library</b><br />In that gif-server I mentioned above, the entire thing was coded without dependencies; including the concurrent parts of it. Go pulls from its standard library similar to Python ("import foo"). What was also nice is that Go has a built-in hash structure, an advantage over C.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Disadvantages</b><br />One of the main disadvantages of the language is that there isn't a huge emphasis on testing. Go has a unit testing module built into its standard library, and Blake mentioned that there are some other testing modules out there built by the community, but it's testing features aren't really comparable to something like Ruby and RSpec.<br /><br />Another disadvantage is the language's funky syntax. It's pretty similar to C, and we all know C isn't known for being very pretty. That being said, a programmer chooses the best tool for the job even if it means ugly syntax, but it may make Go a bit off-putting for a newcomer. Another one of the cool things about dynamic languages is that their syntax is typically very language-like. There's Ruby, Python, and even some Java code that reads like English when composed correctly. It's hard to imagine something similar in Go.<br /><br />Overall, I think Go is a great language that has some potential. It's already built up quite a following and it's backed by a tech giant. If you need something fast and reliable, and you don't want C, consider picking up Go.<br /><br />If you're interested in the code used in the talk, it's hosted here:<br />https://github.com/blakesmith/simple_go<br /><br />Once it's uploaded, I'll post a link to the talk.
