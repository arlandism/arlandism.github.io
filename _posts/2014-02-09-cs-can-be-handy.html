On Friday, Wai Lee and I completed a really cool auto-suggest feature for a client. We implemented it using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem" target="_blank">longest-common-subsequence</a> algorithm - it tries to compare sequences by matching their border elements, stripping them off and recursing with the stripped down version.<br /><br />Wai Lee mentioned that this is a good example of where Computer Science fundamentals come in handy. Being mostly self-taught, I'm often insecure about my lack of a CS background.<br /><br />There were alternative solutions to the problem but since Wai Lee was already pretty familiar with this algorithm we were able to quickly get a solution working without much effort.<br /><br />I find myself thinking about this problem and how I would've solved it by myself. Most likely, I would've googled around until I came to a solution that would've been more difficult to implement and took more time. While I'm confident that with enough time and counsel I could've come up with a solution, I might've missed this relatively simple solution.<br /><br />That being said, I'd really like to dig into more CS fundamentals so I'm not caught off-guard next time.
