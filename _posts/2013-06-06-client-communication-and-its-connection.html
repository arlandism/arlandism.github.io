So I find myself reading Hacker News quite a bit. Sometimes, I'll stumble onto a post about how much meetings suck in the development world. Usually, a developer will be discussing their desire to escape the bureaucracy and fall back into the code. Other times, a company will post a job listing and brag about their lack of meetings and red tape. I never truly understood how meetings and communication really fit into the mold of software development. I'm now starting to learn how the puzzle pieces fit.<br /><br />Crafting good software obviously relies heavily on technical acumen. But, I'm starting to hypothesize that the craft is also heavily dependent on communication. I had the first opportunity to listen in on, and be a part of, an important client meeting today. My teammates and I deliberated for hours on composing a project proposal; this included everything from billing, to choosing a suitable vocabulary for the proposal. The reason we spent so long fine-tuning the proposal is because we want the client to be well-aware of what we can deliver and what to expect out of the product. I found myself pondering the connection between today's meeting and the rest of 8th Light client meetings. Craftsman pride themselves not only on the quality of their code, but also on how well they've met client expectations. Without very concrete talks with the client, there could be no craftsman-molded project. And without solid communication skills these client talks would not go very well. A few years ago, I worked as a freelancer providing articles and content to webmasters. Often, we would hammer out the details first and then I would get to work. There were times however, when project details were not properly discussed and I found myself quickly learning to establish guidelines at the beginning of every project. Poor communication leaves everyone unhappy: the client, the developer, and the product that could've been awesome. More importantly, there can be no concept of software craftsmanship without great communication. That's my take at least.
