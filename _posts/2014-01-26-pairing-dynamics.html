I'll admit it up-front: I'm still not completely sold on pair-programming. I've found that skill levels are so varied and thought patterns so different that inevitably one person ends up doing most of the "driving" while they explore their approach and the other person is left in a state of confusion, frustration, conformance, or a mixture of the three.<div><br /></div><div>This past week, we had a great retro that highlighted some of the pros and cons of the project I'm on. One of the critiques against me was that I seem to shutdown when feeling frustrated or stressed while pairing; this was an excellent analysis. It's up to you and your pair to stay in-sync with one another and communicate any difficulties. Personally, I find this to be extremely difficult in practice and something I struggle with often. Practicing my craft before coming to 8th Light, I would often code lone-wolf style late into the night. Any problems or questions I encountered were just a Google query away. As I transition into a more professional role, I think it's important to acknowledge and actively work on my team-communication skills.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Difficulties</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>Some of the most difficult problems I encounter while pairing are:</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><li>Setting the pace. The driver sets the pace, but how do you measure what a good pace is? There has to be a balance between making sure your pair is keeping up with you and making good headway on a story.</li><li>Acknowledging difficulties. I've been on both sides of the situation where the driver is going too fast. Do you trust the driver and blindly continue down their path? The obvious answer here is no. But, it's difficult to remedy the tension between wanting to keep pace and being embarrassed to ask questions.</li><li>Choosing a toolset. Kelly uses Sublime and I use Vim. We're both really unproductive with the other person's tools. How do we fix this? It's probably best to get somewhat familiar with everyone's tools in order to effectively work but it seems difficult to get used to another editor.</li></ul><div><b>Conclusion</b></div></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>It's not surprising that a lot of the difficulties in pairing naturally arise from the complexities of human interaction. As developers, we were taught that we would mercilessly hack long into the night with nary a social encounter. In the real-world that turns out not to be true; "soft" skills seem just as crucial to successful projects as technical skills are.</div>
