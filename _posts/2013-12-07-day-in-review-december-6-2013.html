Phil and I had our IPM today and it went pretty well. The only hiccup was when Micah realized the weather API wasn't working and we had to explain that we didn't break it. We knew the weather was initially broken, but we had gotten it to show up the day prior so we thought the problem worked itself out. We should've double-checked before the meeting.<br /><br />Micah gave us some feedback on a refactor he thought we should do so I think I'll try to have that done before the next IPM.<br /><br />Thoughts for the day on IPMs:<br /><br /><ul><li>Demonstrate pride in the stories being demoed.&nbsp;</li><li>Mention bugs early in the meeting. Ben Voss gave us good advice last week when he suggested being upfront about regressions. I totally planned on mentioning the problems with the app during the meeting, but some of those problems were displayed during the demos of the features. We should've put the bug list out first.</li><li>Be prepared to wing it if something goes wrong. The main conference room was being used so I scoured the office space (including the basement) for a good place to demo. We found a room just in time.&nbsp;</li></ul>
