I'm halfway through the third week of my apprenticeship and I'm already learning a ton. With each new iteration of my Tic Tac Toe code I feel the principles of the revered Software Craftsman flowing through and empowering me. But, with this enlightenment comes a terrible realization: My codebase smells. My modules are too tightly coupled, classes know about the specifics in other classes, and I have a couple of odd test classes. In short, my code is still highly flawed.   Instead of tearing me a new one, my mentor has given me a list of additional features to be added to the game in order to force me to take a harder look at my abstractions and design. Earlier, I asked him how he, my mentor, came to internalize the vital principles needed by a proficient Software Craftsman, and he noted that he had written smelly code before and saw how it came back to haunt him. So his strategy for my learning is to allow me to trudge the depths of my swampy code and learn why I should've taken the non-swampy path sooner. I usually learn a new principle everyday, and find myself refactoring in an attempt to adhere to this new principle. As I move deeper into my system and try to add new features I find that the non-swampy path is indeed more desirable.  For this week, I'll be implementing JSON output for the game, enabling a feature that invokes Unix's built-in "say" command to get an audio representation of the board, adding AI vs. AI, Human vs. Human, and a Humanoid player comprised of some Human and some AI moves. This will be quite the challenge and hopefully after completing it I'll have a stronger sense of good design, clean code, and meaningful abstractions.
