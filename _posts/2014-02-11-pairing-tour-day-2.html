<b>Background</b><br /><br />Craftsman: Nhu Nguyen<br /><br />I didn't learn a whole lot about the project's architecture but Nhu and I spent the day working with Java's Spring framework and trying to integrate Fitnesse. I overheard other developers in the room discussing Rails so I know that hooks in somewhere.<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><b><br /></b>I didn't realize how complex Java's dependency pipeline is. Editing pom.xml configuration files really made me miss Ruby's Bundler and Clojure's Leiningen. The day was spent hunting through StackOverflow questions, Fitnesse documentation, and Spring configuration. We made incremental progress throughout the day but didn't achieve our end goal which was to successfully get a dummy test running.
