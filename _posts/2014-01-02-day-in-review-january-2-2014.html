Today, I started pairing with Wai Lee on a client project. It was pretty fun to get setup on a *real* Clojure project that will have actual users.<br /><br />We started the day off by working on some HTTP auth stuff and knocking out a story. We wrapped the day up on the heels of a new feature for the project.<br /><br />There was a bit of trouble near the end of the day as we found out that one of the libraries we had been using was broken and we had to quickly find an alternative. All in all, it was a good day.<br /><br />Takeaways:<br /><br /><ul><li>It was cool to see how much client interaction plays a role in the day-to-day work of the project. During the course of our feature work we had to directly contact the stakeholder to get more details; this kind of interaction helps remove the ambiguities between what the developers think the software should do and what the client wants the software to do.</li><li>Don't depend on Chrome when trying to view the HTTP auth request it sends to a server, it hides a bunch of useful data from you. The underlying lesson here may be not to depend too much on it for anything.</li><li>Whenever someone on the team has changes to add they submit a pull request so other people on the team can get familiar with the code and catch any mistakes. This is a really good idea for obvious reasons; it also helped us catch the broken library issue before the code made it to master.</li></ul>
