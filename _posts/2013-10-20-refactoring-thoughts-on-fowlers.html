I'm enjoying Fowler's "Refactoring" book, but I've found that it's really easy for me to get lost in the details. The primary reason for this is the incremental approach that Fowler takes to the refactoring process.<br /><br />Simple, easy-win refactorings like renaming complicated Boolean expressions, or extracting smaller pieces of functionality from larger ones have become such a standard part of my workflow that I find myself only half paying attention when reading through Fowler's examples. This usually leads to a gap when I notice that Fowler has walked through a complicated refactoring and I don't fully understand how he got there.<br /><br />Though the book's pace is slow sometimes, I actually like the incremental way he does things. Whenever I perform a refactor, I immediately take huge steps. This often breaks my code in some way and I end up performing undo commands to get back where I was in order to restart. Fowler's techniques are a lot slower, but are far less likely to confuse you and probably save time in the long run.
