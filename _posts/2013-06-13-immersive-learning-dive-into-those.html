Barely into my apprenticeship, I'm already starting to pick up some really good habits. One of these habits is to dive into unfamiliar libraries and immediately begin working with them. Right now, my major project, Tic Tac Toe, is written entirely in Python. I'm pretty well-versed in Python, but certainly not fluent. Many of the modules in its standard library remain a mystery to me, and sometimes I can't even trudge through the sometimes-too-technical jargon on its documentation page. Or at least I couldn't before. Now, it's all too common to find that I need to do something and look up the documentation for what I need to do. Diving into unfamiliar libraries is starting to feel normal. And that all-too-technical jargon doesn't seem so technical anymore. After you've done some extensive work on a project and worked with some knowledgeable peers, the language of documentation starts to seem more familiar; it's definitely more approachable. And once you've become familiar with this language, jumping into a new library and working with some new code isn't intimidating at all. Here are some things to keep in mind for the aspiring Indiana Jones programmer.<br /><br /><b>Check the Documentation</b><br />This is a pretty obvious tip. If you're going to use any unfamiliar code then you should check the code's official documentation. No one knows the codebase better than the people that wrote it. Usually, there are some good usage cases and examples. But, if there aren't, check out the next tip.<br /><br /><b>StackOverFlow Is Your Friend</b><br />Sometimes, it's hard to weed out the knowledgeable people from everyone else, but there are plenty of good code snippets to be found. If you're having difficulty with a library, then odds are that someone else has had a similar problem. I've found that someone has usually posted the exact problem I'm facing on StackOverFlow. It's the next best thing to the official documentation and can be even better if you can't understand the technical documentation.<br /><br /><b>Use the Interpreter</b><br />This tip is specifically for interpreted languages. Actually playing with the code you're trying to understand makes it a lot easier to get a feel for it and what it should do. I'm even starting to do this with my own codebase when I reach a level of abstraction and I can't remember its implementation.<br /><br />Understanding and implementing the latest technologies is a pretty common occurrence in this field. Getting used to it and embracing it is another part of being a good developer. There will always be new libraries and new ways of doing things, so it would be wise to get acclimated and over the initial fear of &nbsp;diving into unfamiliar code.
