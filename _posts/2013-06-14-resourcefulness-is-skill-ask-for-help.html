It's no coincidence that pride is amongst the deadly sins in the Christian faith. Often, it is because of pride that we are afraid to ask for help on things that we genuinely need help with. "I'll figure it out eventually"; that's an excuse I always use. Well, that doesn't fly in an apprenticeship. Indeed, if you already knew all of the answers, then there'd be no point of an apprenticeship now would there?<br /><br />For example, I'll often find that I'm working on some new concept that I don't completely understand. I'll try it on my own for awhile to no avail. Eventually, I reach the conclusion that I should probably ask for help. My insight is probably correct, and I probably should ask for help. But, I am a proud person. "They'll think I'm dumb if I keep asking for help. Everyone else got it done easily enough, I should be able to as well." My brain is quite the talker in these situations.<br /><br />Truth is, we all struggle with different concepts and could all use some help now and again. No one's a genius, and it's important to keep that in mind. I was talking with <a href="http://telladifferentstory.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Kelly</a>, one of the other apprentices, and she mentioned that one of the key things valued during the apprenticeship is resourcefulness. You have to be able to solve problems. And if you don't know how to solve problems, then you have to be willing to find someone that does and learn from them. This is a key principle of the apprenticeship process. It is also something that's very new to me. I've often been in situations where I was the one being asked for help, not doing the asking. It's a humbling experience to know that you need help, but it's an enlightening experience when you actually seek that help out. Suddenly, you realize that other people have probably struggled with the same problems. You open your eyes to the fact that a truly smart person wouldn't keep trying to do something that they obviously can't do; the truly intelligent individual knows their own limits and knows when to seek help.<br /><br />Overall, I think resourcefulness is a skill that should be truly valued. Whether you get these resources from a book or another person doesn't matter. You need the drive and wisdom to know that when facing a formidable problem, it's probably best to consult someone that's overcome that problem. Apprenticeship is a humbling experience for many reasons. This is certainly one of them. Ask for help, and you may find that the problems you're facing actually get solved.
