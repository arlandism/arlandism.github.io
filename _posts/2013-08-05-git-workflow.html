<div><br /></div><div>I knew absolutely nothing about git coming into my apprenticeship, but I've already learned a ton. I thought this would be a good opportunity to reflect and come up with a brief beginner-friendly tutorial.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Configuration</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>First, let's get into a directory that we want git to watch.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><pre class="brush:bash" name="code">mkdir my_project_dir<br />cd my_project_dir<br />git init my_project_dir<br />Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/arlandislawrence/development/my_project_dir/.git/</pre><br />We've initialized an empty git repository and we should get a status message confirming it. While we're configuring, we should probably create a .gitignore file. This is a settings file that tells git we don't want the stuff listed to show up.<br /><br /><br /><pre class="brush:bash" name="code">touch .gitignore<br /></pre><br />We've created the file, but there's nothing in it yet. I'll leave that to you. Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/arlandism/6161007" target="_blank">my .gitignore file</a> if you're looking for examples. It's a good idea to ignore executables, binary files, text-editor generated stuff, etc.<br /><br /><b>Workflow</b><br /><b><br /></b>We've got git initialized. Let's do some stuff.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:bash" name="code">echo 'Gonna be a git pro!' &gt; message.txt<br />git status<br /># On branch master<br />#<br /># Initial commit<br />#<br /># Untracked files:<br />#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)<br />#<br /># message.txt<br /></file></pre><br />That should create a message.txt file in your current working directory. You can run "git status" to see what's changed in your directory. Now run "git add" to add that changed file and run "git status" to see it staged.<br /><br /><br /><pre class="brush:bash" name="code">git add message.txt<br />git status<br /># On branch master<br />#<br /># Initial commit<br />#<br /># Changes to be committed:<br />#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)<br />#<br /># new file:   message.txt<br />#<br /></file></pre><br /><b>*Pro tip: </b>Run "git add -u" to add every changed file that's already being tracked.<br /><br />Now we have our changed file staged - it's ready to be committed. <br /><pre class="brush:bash" name="code">git commit -m "Add message.txt"<br />[master (root-commit) 700309b] Add message.txt<br /> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)<br /> create mode 100644 message.txt<br /></pre><br />Awesome! Those are the very basics of using git. Those are pretty much the only commands I use on a daily basis, but there are quite a few others that one should be familiar with; I'm not familiar with them so I won't moonlight as a git pro.<br /><br />I think I should make one important note before ending: Git and Github are not the same thing. When I started programming, I thought that git was just an API for Github. Git is a version control tool, while Github is a site for storing your git repositories. On the bright side, "pushing" your repositories to Github doesn't require much more effort.<br /><br />Itching to become a Git pro?
