<b>Background</b><br /><b><br /></b>Craftsman: Dave Moore<br /><br />Dave works on multiple projects and is often juggling development work with stakeholder communication and project staffing.<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><br />I spent Friday pairing with Dave, though there wasn't much programming involved. Dave has some seniority at the company so he spends a good chunk of his time doing project management.<br /><br />We started the day out with an IPM for one of the projects that Dave oversees. Dave gave me an overview of the project and told me about the features to be showcased for the demo. The client was integrating a pretty crucial part of their application so it was a big deal. Mostly, we just sat in on the demo, with Dave interjecting to resolve any ambiguities between the stakeholder and the development team.<br /><br />Once that was over we had a staffing meeting with Eric Smith; Eric also acts as a project manager. After the powwow with Eric, we learned that Colin would be available for some work during the next couple of weeks so we recruited him to one of Dave's projects.<br /><br />Finally, we finished our pairing with some code review for a pull request that I wanted to submit to the previous project I had been on. Dave and I cleaned up the code a bit but had to stop because of company standup.<br /><br />Though there wasn't much programming, I had a lot of fun working with Dave. It was interesting to see how projects get staffed and the way in which senior 8th Lighters also work as project managers.
