I've been anticipating my most recent assignment ever since I started four months ago. There are a number of different stories on the backlog, they're all components of an http server. I'm extremely excited about this project. While I've been warned by my fellow apprentices that this excitement dies as the project progresses, I can't help but feel optimistic.<br /><br /><b>Reasons For Excitement</b><br /><b><br /></b><br /><ul><li>Java - I haven't written Java code in about a year, but back when I started in the legendary enterprise language it quickly became one of my favorites. You can't argue with the fast feedback loop and amazing prototyping skills that you get from dynamic languages, but there's something about working with a static language that feels good. Complementing this philosophy is the fact that many (all?) of the SOLID principles emphasized at 8th Light were written with static languages in mind. Sometimes, I've found it conceptually difficult to apply certain principles (ISP) in dynamic languages. It'll be cool to become more acquainted with these principles in the environment they were conceived in.</li></ul><div><br /></div><ul><li>Web Technology - There's still so much magic that floats by me unnoticed on the web. I'm anxious to peel back the layers and increase my understanding of the Internet. My recent Sinatra application helped a lot in this area, but I still have a long way to go. I hope to dig through some RFC specifications and feel like a "real" programmer.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br /></div><ul><li>IntelliJ - I've grown pretty comfortable, and content, with Vim, but I'm interested in seeing what another development environment has to offer. My real reason for excitement about using IntelliJ is that, depending on how the server works out, I'm thinking of switching to writing Clojure in it.&nbsp;</li></ul>
