For the last couple of months, I've been trying to get into the mindset of an entrepreneur. I'm trying to see the world through a more creative lens and imagine new ways of bringing together ideas from different fields, philosophies, and technologies. For me, this helps frame my day-to-day progress and define my goals. For instance, right now I'm employed as a software developer at a SAAS company. My official title is "Ruby Engineer", but that's only what my role is in the organization. In reality, I'm an entrepreneur learning how SAAS businesses operate. For the company, I write and finish features, discuss technical strategy, engage in peer code review, and provie status reports on my progress. For myself, I learn how to scope and manage new software additions, understand how software engineers collaborate and grow codebases, and learn how to communicate technically-heavy feature additions in terms that non-software people can understand.

It's hard to know exactly when I've learned enough to be competent, but introspecting on my everyday experiences helps me feel like I'm growing.
