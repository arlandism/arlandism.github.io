I've been watching a lot of videos from [MicroConf]("http://www.microconf.com/past-videos/") and it's been terrific inspiration. For a long time now I've felt that entrepreneurship was the "right" path for me; at least as close to "right" as I was going to get. When I work, I like to think I'm giving it everything I've got. Each moment, I'm trying to work as hard as I can, no matter what the project. It's always a little unsettling to know that while this effort may get me some recognition and a pay bump, I can't reap the larger benefits.

Don't get me wrong. I enjoy what I do and certainly believe that I'm paid handsomely for it. I just want more skin in the game. I want to carve my own legacy and build something from scratch.

I've come up with dozens of reasons not to venture out on my own:

- I'm not experienced enough
- I don't have a business background
- I don't have enough of a financial cushion
- I don't have an idea for a project


I won't say that these aren't "legitimate" excuses in one way or another, but just enumerating your excuses doesn't get you anywhere either. So, I've decided to finally take on the challenge this year of starting, and hopefully finishing, actual products.
