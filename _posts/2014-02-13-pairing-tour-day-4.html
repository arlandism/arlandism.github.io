<b>Background</b><br /><b><br /></b>Craftsman: Angelique Martin (CFO)<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><b><br /></b>Today, I got an interesting peak at the internals of 8th Light and all the wheels that need to turn in order for things to go smoothly. Angelique and I spent the day working and discussing financial, legal, and administrative tasks for the company. Unfortunately, most of what we discussed has to be kept private, so there's not much for me to talk about. Some of the non-private, and expected, tasks were: exploring accounting software, sending emails, making phone calls, and discussing the role that 8th Light craftsmen play in the grand scheme of things. I came away from today with a much deeper understanding and gratitude for all of the tasks that 8th Light administrators take on and what it takes to run a company.<br /><br /><br />
