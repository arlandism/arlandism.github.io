<a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/wai-lee-chin-feman" target="_blank">Wai Lee</a> sent me a very interesting story recently: <b>The Dexterous Butcher</b> by Chuang Tzu. The tale highlights the wisdom and skillfulness of a butcher that has continually worked to perfect his craft. I immediately saw the parallels between the butcher's story and the aspiring software craftsman's journey.<br /><br />The full story - in two slight variations - can be found <a href="http://www.bopsecrets.org/gateway/passages/chuang-tzu.htm" target="_blank">here</a>. For the sake of brevity, I'll highlight some of my favorite lines and elaborate on the connection I see to software craftsmanship. <br /><br />"Cook Ting was cutting up an ox for Lord Wen-hui. As every touch of his hand,  every heave of his shoulder, every move of his feet, every thrust of his knee... all was in perfect rhythm..." - To me, this part of the story hints at the various nuances the butcher has mastered to perfect his craft. When I think of a butcher, I immediately imagine a cleaver being gracelessly hacked into an awaiting carcass; yet this story suggests otherwise. The butcher has grown accustomed to perfecting every detail involved in the act of butchering. This brings to mind an image of a disciplined software craftsmen, tirelessly renaming variables, functions, and classes until they express his/her intent perfectly.<br /><br />"""“Ah, this is marvelous!” said Lord Wen-hui. “Imagine skill reaching such  heights!”""" - The nobleman is just as shocked as anyone would be watching someone exercise their disciplines perfectly. This also seems to hint at the naivete of an outsider seeing the hard work that goes into the polished products they're used to seeing.<br /><br />"What I care about is the Way, which  goes beyond skill. When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the  ox itself." - I was very tempted to paste the entire excerpt that this section is from. First, the butcher talks about how his process is more important to him than the end result. It seems to reasonably follow that if the process has been perfected, then you can expect the end result to be impressive; of course this doesn't apply all the time. Later, the butcher starts to elaborate on his humble beginnings. Initially, he had to focus hard on the mechanics of carving the meat. I imagine him repeatedly trying to angle the knife and continuously failing to reach his goal. Not only does this portion of the story suggest perseverance, it also starts to elaborate on what author Robert Greene calls "a cycle of accelerated returns". A very concrete example of this is starting out in Test-Driven Development. You begin by drilling the three laws deep into your brain. You constantly focus on trying to get the execution right; figure out the next test, make sure it expresses the API. Eventually, after many hardships, your tests get better because you start to understand the TDD cycle conceptually. You finally grasp the concept of fully exercising your system as you write it.<br /><br />“A good cook changes his knife once a year — because he cuts. A mediocre cook  changes his knife once a month — because he hacks. I’ve had this knife of mine  for nineteen years and I’ve cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet the blade  is as good as though it had just come from the grindstone." - You get much more use out of something when you don't "hack" away with it. Hacked code is soon-to-be discarded code.<br /><br />"...whenever I come to a complicated place, I size up the difficulties,  tell myself to watch out and be careful, keep my eyes on what I’m doing, work  very slowly..." - The butcher may be a master at his craft, but he certainly doesn't know all of the tricks. When he encounters a new situation, he holds to his disciplines and pushes through the problem. Programmers are forced to encounter and deal with new situations/technologies all the time. Technology is constantly evolving - it's the underlying concepts and disciplines that matter.<br /><br />"""“Excellent!” said Lord Wen-hui. “I have heard the words of Cook Ting and  learned how to care for life!”""" - The nobleman has come to the realization that I came to after reading the story: craftsmanship is a way of life. Watching the butcher perform has taught the nobleman to pay closer attention to the subtleties of life and strive for perfection in even the smallest of details.
