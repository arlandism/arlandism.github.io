I wrapped up a new feature on my server today: you can now toggle the various features that you want enabled.<br />This is implemented via the command line where you set feature flags to true or false.<br />After finishing, I decided to refactor by taking a second look at the newly written code.<br />This code stood out to me:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:java" name="code">public interface Toggler {<br />    Boolean isEnabled(String route);<br />}<br /></pre><br />You'll notice that this "Toggler" interface only has the "isEnabled" method defined on it.<br />To me, the name of this interface doesn't match up with what it's actually being used for. Were this my first time reading the code, I would think that something implementing the "Toggler" interface would give me the ability to, well, toggle! I didn't like the fact that the "Toggler" didn't actually let me toggle, so I decided to rename it.<br /><br />The method "isEnabled" is interrogative, so I brainstormed names that reflected this querying ability. I thought "Directory" was a great name! In the same manner that you would look at a building directory to get a sense of what's in the building, the "Directory" lets you know which features are there.<br /><br />Though I was pretty sold on this name, I remembered the context of the problem.<br />One of the features of the server is the ability to browse the local filesystem. Having the word "directory" in a name could make things fuzzy for the uninitiated. Reluctantly, I discarded this perfect name in search of another.<br /><br />Finally, I settled on "Inventory". It's not as good as "Directory", but carries the same kind of meaning and accurately reflects its methods.
