Wow, estimating is hard! It looks like I'll be missing the mark on my estimations this week and that's certainly not a good thing. I thought it might be helpful to hear what Uncle Bob has to say on the subject.<br /><br /><b>Uncle Bob's Thoughts</b><br /><b><br /></b>Uncle Bob talks a little bit about estimating <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/04/20/Why-Is-Estimating-So-Hard.html" target="_blank">here</a>. What's funny is that in this post he mentions how programmers tend to overestimate seemingly simple tasks just because the algorithm to complete the tasks is already familiar. For instance, one of the estimates that I was off on was<a href="https://github.com/arlandism/n-body" target="_blank"> my Clojure N-Bodies calculator</a>. The general algorithm is displayed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem" target="_blank">here</a> on Wikipedia. I analyzed the formula for a while, figured it would be simple enough to implement, and set my horrible estimate in stone. What set back this estimate? Well, it was sort of like what Uncle Bob mentioned in the post. Just because the algorithm is relatively simple to implement on paper doesn't mean that it's easy to program into a computer. Perhaps more importantly, an algorithm's final code implementation should be clean and elegant, which is hard to get right.<br /><br /><b>Setbacks</b><br /><b><br /></b>So, what exactly makes estimation hard? Well, for me, there are a quite a few things I need to consider: scope of the problem, familiarity with tools, refactorings, debug time, other duties, etc. That's a lot of stuff to keep in mind. And I didn't even mention the implicit pressure for stories; in order to spare your ego you'll most likely feel an inclination towards low estimates for tasks that <i>seem</i> simple. How do you juggle all of these things and meaningfully quantify them? This is something I'm struggling with.
