Today marked the end of my first week as an apprentice and I must say that I've never been more excited. I've begun an incredible journey and when it's over I'm sure I'll have learned more than I even thought possible to learn in 8 months. This week's introduction to apprenticeship, and to 8th Light, has been both&nbsp;exhilarating and humbling.<br /><br />You come into the apprenticeship program thinking that you can code pretty decently. Maybe you have a CS degree, or maybe you already have tons of experience writing complex software systems. Great! You don't know half as much as you think you know. I was neither of the above. I don't have a CS degree and I haven't coded even small-scale software systems. But, I see myself as a pretty decent problem-solver and I was at least a decent enough programmer to land this gig. Alas, the apprenticeship has lifted my veil of misplaced pride and security. I'm a horrible programmer! And I'm sure that a lot of people are upon entering the apprenticeship. 8th Light has a very good intuition about whom they can mold into good programmers, and this is how they choose apprentices. They know our code sucks before they hire us. But that's the entire point of apprenticeship. Slowly, our code will start to suck less and less until it eventually becomes what one could consider "good".<br /><br />Coming into the program I was concerned that it would be very corporate-like. That the craftsmen were all business and wanted very little to do with apprentices and our elementary concerns. That my mentor would assign some trivial project and send me on my way. Nothing could be further from the truth. Not only is asking questions okay, but it's actually encouraged. My mentor is terrific and encourages my fumbling attempts at writing good code. The craftsmen are some of the smartest, literally some of the smartest - they have credentials, experience, and raw intelligence like you wouldn't believe, and most welcoming people that I've come across. And the culture at 8th Light is phenomenal. I've always read about Google, Facebook, etc. and all of the awesome perks their engineers enjoy. I didn't realize that 8th Light would have a lot of those perks, but with the advantage of being a much smaller company and feeling more family-like. I can't think of a better place to grow and thrive as a programmer.<br /><br />At my interview Micah, our CTO and co-founder, likened software apprenticeship to cooking after I mentioned I was a line-cook. He said that initially you cook this terrible tasting food that's not worth eating. Over time though you get better, and start to produce some pretty good food. I like to think that right now I'm getting my bearings in the kitchen and trying to locate the spice rack.
