I met with my mentor today and, unsurprisingly, was schooled on some core principles that I thought I knew well.<br /><br /><b>Not Getting Stuck</b><br /><b><br /></b>One of the primary benefits of ideal Test-Driven Development is that you're not supposed to get stuck. The red-green-refactor cycle is meant to be extremely short - a couple of minutes at most. This is so that, worst-case scenario - you can't come up with a simple solution to a failing test, so you undo your latest changes and your tests are still green, at which point you can try writing a different test to see if you can get it to pass. While this seems simple enough, it has some creeping implications.<br /><br />I find that I'll write what I deem to be a useful test and try to get it to pass. Typically, I'll spend up to 20-30 minutes trying to make this individual case to pass; usually I'm operating under the assumption that I just need to try harder to determine a solution. Ironically, while one of the defining characteristics of software development is that it's hard, the TDD cycle emphasizes implementing "trivial" solutions. In this context, I mean "trivial" as in implementing solutions that are trivial to conceptualize - not solutions that are useless. On a larger scale, what this means is that the 20-30 minutes that I spend looking for a solution is time that would be better spent writing smaller tests. I should be test-driving lots of smaller functions that I can later compose into a working solution, as opposed to trying to test-drive entire algorithms in one chunk. This method not only ensures more confidence in my code, it also promises easier tests and easier-to-write production code.<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><b><br /></b>More experienced XP practitioners are probably very familiar with the notion of "not getting stuck". But, I think that us Agile newbies get so overwhelmed with adhering to the disciplines that we don't quite grasp why those disciplines are actually useful. I've often seen kata performances where the presenter flies through writing the tests and the production code, staying green the whole time. I dismissed these feats as nonrealistic - ideal solutions to trivial problems. There's no way "real" code is written like that, but that's exactly how it should be written. The TDD feedback loop should be so tight that you don't even realize you're making progress until you take a step back.
