Wow! It's amazing how fast three weeks go by. Thus far in my apprenticeship I've worked on several facets of craftsmanship: project estimation, teamwork, client relationships, and development, of course. It's really amazing to look back over three weeks and realize how much I've learned in this short span.<br /><br />Not to scare anyone off, but an 8th Light apprenticeship is really difficult, and not for the faint of heart. Either you can work your ass off, learn the things you need to learn, master the skills you need to master, and become a craftsman, or you could not do those things and get let go. I actually read a blog post recently about an apprentice that didn't make the cut. This really brought me back to reality. Although I've made it into an apprenticeship, I'm not guaranteed employment at the end. Only by continually giving it all my effort and never being content will I make it as a craftsman. Being an 8th Light apprentice is an amazing opportunity and honor, but with that honor comes a lot of responsibility. Anywho, on to less-grim topics. I'll end the blog post with some interesting snippets about my apprenticeship so far.<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>I've started using <a href="http://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a> as my editor/IDE. It's pretty powerful, but takes some getting used to. Originally, I was using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a> and only made the switch because everyone at the office uses it so I figured it'd be pretty good to be proficient in it.</li><li>I've learned a ton about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">test-driven development</a>. The philosophy has some great points and is one of the key reasons 8th Light is able to produce such great software.</li><li>I've learned a ton about "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" target="_blank">clean code</a>". "Clean code" describes code that is concise, elegant, and that acts as it's supposed to with minimal side effects. It produces software that is maintainable and robust.</li><li>I've started learning Ping-pong. I really suck at it right now though. It's fun nonetheless.</li><li>I've met some cool people. 8th Light is extremely diverse and carries a wide range of personalities. The primary commonality is that everyone is extremely bright.</li><li>I think a lot more about design. I'm used to just pushing code out, but now I'm forced to think about abstractions, patterns, and all sorts of other things.</li><li>I can read and understand foreign code. This snippet is actually kind of strange. I don't know when or how I picked this up. I think it's because after writing your own well-written systems you begin looking for the same kinds of abstractions, APIs, etc. in other people's code. This also translates to reading other languages.</li><li>I've transitioned and seen some of the "real-world" of software development. Though I'm all for education and learning interesting theories, modern computer science curriculums often emphasize math-intensive courseloads. I could see how discrete math is especially useful, but I haven't had to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'H%C3%B4pital's_rule" target="_blank">L'hopital's rule</a> once since I've been here. No integrals, nothing. And I haven't heard mention of any of it either.</li><li>I've heard lots of great talks via <a href="http://university.8thlight.com/" target="_blank">8th Light University</a>, and eaten lots of free food.</li></ul>
