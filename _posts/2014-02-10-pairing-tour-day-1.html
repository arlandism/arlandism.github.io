<b>Background</b><br /><b><br /></b>Craftsman: Rylan Dirksen<br /><br />Rylan's part of a team - one of many - that focuses on the integration of subsets of data into the system (This may not be the most accurate description). The application Rylan's team works on is a chunk of a much larger and more complex Rails architecture that's in the process of being modularized.<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><br />Rylan and I pulled a storycard with a Unicode bug issue. We spent a lot of the day trying, unsuccessfully, to replicate the error listed in the card. After some hunting, we found what we thought was the correct fix for the bug, but we couldn't be sure because of the unsuccessful replication; we ended up submitting the pull request near the end of the day. To wrap up, we attended a team retrospective where the team discussed pro/con issues that arose over the last week.<br /><br />It was cool to watch the dynamics of such a large team. I found that their workflow closely resembled the client project I was just on with Wai Lee, Dave, and Kelly, which isn't a surprise since both Dave and Wai Lee have worked for this client before. It was also interesting to watch their adaptation of Agile processes like standup, retro, story tracking, etc.
