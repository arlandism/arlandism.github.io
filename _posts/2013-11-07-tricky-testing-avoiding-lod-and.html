I'm in an interesting test situation right now that is forcing me to re-evaluate my testing strategy. I'm in the process of writing a "Logger" class that will output to a file. I don't want to pollute my tests for the class by including the filesystem, so I'm putting a "getLogs" message on the class to check that things are being logged the way I expect. But, this puts me in a bit of an awkward situation. Internally, I want the Logger to place its messages on a queue before sending them out. But, exposing this internal storage mechanism through the "getLogs" method is a clear LoD violation.<br /><br />Ideally, you test behavior in a situation like this one. But, that would force me to take a look at the filesystem. How do I get around both of these nasty behaviors?<br /><br /><b>Options</b><br /><br />I see two clear options right now:<br /><br /><ol><li>I think that the LoD is primarily devised to protect against the volatility of an interface. This makes sense in the case that I decide to change the data structure I'm using for the messages. I could write my own abstraction over the data structure; then if I decide to change that data structure, that change will be hidden under my wrapper.</li><li>The second option is to just use the filesystem. This sucks because I'd prefer not to use the filesystem in a test unless it's my only option. On the plus side, this would allow me to delete the "getLogs" method altogether, which is good since it represents a bit of a ISP violation because the test is the only consumer of that method, and I don't see a reason for anyone else to use it.</li></ol><br />
