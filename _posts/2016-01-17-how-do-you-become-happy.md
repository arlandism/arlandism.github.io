I just finished reading Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert.

There doesn't seem to be a magic pill here. One of the best answers I've heard is that happiness isn't a state so much as it's a label.

Assigning a label to your future self's state of mind isn't useful. Do you have a problem? Is there something you need you're not getting? If so, then you should fix those problems. Speculating about your future happiness doesn't do you any favors.

If you're weighing an important decision, it's easier, and more likely to yield an accurate emotional prediction, if you ask someone experiencing the ramifications of that choice right now how they feel.
