I've come to a point in my code where it's time to implement multi-threading. I knew that this would be a big testing hurdle and I wasn't sure how I would handle it, but in true Agile fashion I delayed that train of thought until it was time to deal with it. The first part of the challenge is to figuring out how to test if a thread is sleeping, since implementing some sleep functionality is on my storyboard this week.<br /><br /><b>Testing Options</b><br /><b><br /></b>So one option that would work fairly well is to write a Thread interface so that I can implement a mock Thread and make some kind of boolean assertion about whether or not its "sleep" method got called. The problem with this approach is that I don't like the idea of testing against some odd state change. I would much rather prefer some kind of behavioral test, but unfortunately that doesn't seem like it's an option in this case.<br /><br />I was hoping to scour the web and determine what other developers have done in similar situations but my searches thus far have yielded few promising results.
