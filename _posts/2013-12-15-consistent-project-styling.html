During our IPM this past Friday, Micah gave Phil and I some good insight on working collaboratively. One of the important concepts that stood out to me was consistent style.<br /><br />I've found myself able to pinpoint who wrote certain parts of the dojo-dashboard codebase based on that code's styling; by styling, I mean everything from indentation to idiom. While having a distinctive programming style is fine, it doesn't serve a project well. Style inconsistencies leave future developers confused about which approach to take and increases the speed of code entropy. <br /><br />Reflecting on these thoughts, I've realized that Phil and I have become guilty of the same violations. During an iteration we'll start pairing, but inevitably split off, usually mid-week. Eventually, we merge our work together with very little code review; we're usually pressed for time at this point. This is a bad practice and won't help to improve the project's code as a whole. In future iterations, I'm going to keep these kinds of nuances in mind during the estimation process.
