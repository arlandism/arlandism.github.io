Yesterday, my team did it's first ever team estimation. This isn't to say that the project didn't already have estimations, but it was the first time that the current members of the team had actually estimated the stories as a group.<br /><br />I like that we did this exercise because it enabled us to set the pace for future stories. Thus far, we've had our pace dictated by the estimations already present on the backlog; this is unfair because past members of the team probably had different levels of context, experience, etc. In the case of overly optimistic estimations, you may find yourself putting in overtime to try and meet deadlines. Conversely, previous estimates may be too high and you may subconsciously drag a story out to match the estimation already listed.<br /><br />Adding to the problem, re-estimating stories that have already been estimated seems unfair to stakeholders. They were given estimations and planned the project's progress accordingly. Saying "Hey, we're going to need to toss out all of our old estimations because we have a new team now" would probably make the stakeholder uneasy.<br /><br /><b>Solution</b><br /><br />One possible, not necessarily pragmatic, solution would be to estimate a fixed number of points. This number corresponds to the *known* length of time that the current team or at least most of them, would still be around. As a consultancy, 8th Light shuffles craftsmen around a lot to meet different needs. This is well-known and understood, but it seems like you *usually* see it coming when you'll be shifting projects. After a shift in team members, have the new members go through the same process. I say this solution isn't necessarily pragmatic since clients may want project projections for their own planning needs. <br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br /><b><br /></b>This is a difficult problem to solve, but I think it's worth addressing. It's difficult to join a team and find yourself frantically pacing to complete an infrastructure story estimated at half the points you would've estimated because the original estimator wrote the book on nginx configuration.
