Since starting on the dojo-dashboard project, I've wondered how to balance the need to get stories completed with the need to work with clean code. While I initially thought that I was boy-scouting too much, Micah assured us during our last IPM that we shouldn't be afraid to completely rip out pieces of the system that could be better. This was astounding to me because I wasn't expecting this kind of answer. When your primary job is to push new features, you don't expect to hear that you should also rewrite code that's already functional (and that you didn't write).<br /><br />Micah informed us that our strategy was actually hurting the system more than helping it. By writing code in our own style, without changing the existing code to match our new standards, we were killing the conformity of the system.<br /><br />I think this has interesting implications with regard to decisions we make about the code in the future. Every change should match with the system's standard, or we should rewrite where necessary to make the standard our own; I think we'll find ourselves making the latter decision most often.<br /><br />Initially, it seemed like a good idea to stick with certain idioms already set forth by the previous team, even if we didn't completely agree with them. Not only were we scared of possible regressions, but we were also worried about the time implications.<br /><br />I think that part of the reason these kinds of decisions are hard for us is because of our limited exposure to reviewing/editing existing code. I suspect that possible refactors we want to make wouldn't be nearly as time-consuming to our more experienced colleagues, and thus the decision to actually go ahead and implement them would be easier. Of course I don't think this is true for all cases, but in an app of this scope I think it holds true.<br /><br />How do we address this? Put simply, I think we should get better at refactoring and determining what kinds of changes we need to make. Then, decisions like whether or not we should rewrite smelly code will become easier, since time won't be as much of a concern.<br /><br />Some of these thoughts resonate well with my <a href="http://immutablearlandis.blogspot.com/2013/12/consistent-project-styling.html" target="_blank">last post</a>.
