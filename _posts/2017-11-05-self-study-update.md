Discrete math didn't work out so well. I watched a few of the MIT lectures and they were somewhat compelling (largely due to the amazing instructor), but I started to bang my head against proofs and lost interest. I did manage to do a few simple proofs (poorly, no doubt) and I'm somewhat proud of that. Discrete math will remain on my TODO list, but I don't think self-study will work for it in my case. I may end up doing a course from the local community college as a "forcing" function. I think that's the only way I'll actually force myself through it.

In other news, operating systems is working out really well! I started reading chapters in the UWisconsin "Meteor" book and it's interesting enough to keep going. I even decided to order a physical copy of the book and a C reference manual. MIT also has a great little book on their "toy" operating system that I plan to check out (with source code!).
