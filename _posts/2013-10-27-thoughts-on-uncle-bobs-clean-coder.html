I just wrapped up Uncle Bob's "Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers". In it, he addresses various thoughts on professionalism, professional improvement, team dynamics, and estimation through a series of entertaining anecdotes drawn from his career.<br /><br />Overall, I found the book extremely enjoyable - filled with snippets of Uncle Bob's characteristic humor. Plus, it was a nice break from the denser "Clean Code" and "Agile Software Development" books. The biggest takeaways for me were maintaining professional composure even if it means saying no, holding steadfast to your disciplines under pressure, and throwing away the tempting "one-man army" stance about your code, in favor of pair-programming and collective ownership.<br /><br />There were other parts of the book that were a bit more controversial. But, Uncle Bob gave an explicit disclosure that some topics were his personal opinion. Some of those controversial parts were:<br /><ul><li>In one portion of the book, Uncle Bob very subtly insinuates that you <i>may not </i>be considered a professional if you don't use TDD. Though I'm all for TDD, there were many professionals before its advent, and there is tons of great software written now by non-TDDers.&nbsp;</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Twenty hours a week is the practicing minimum that Uncle Bob advises. I think it's safe to say that this number is somewhat arbitrary. The point seemed to be that you should be actively improving at your craft. For people with busier lives I could see how this would be impractical.</li></ul>&nbsp; <br /><ul><li>Uncle Bob says that being "in the zone" is bad because of the tunnel-vision being experienced while in it. He says that you should actively fight against the zone as you'll end up writing code that you need to fix later. This seemed like a bit of a stretch to me. People are physiologically unique; while my "flow" may be sloppy and unprofessional, you may write the greatest software in the world while "in the zone".</li></ul>I really liked the book and plan to use it as a periodical reference as my career develops. I think that Uncle Bob makes it clear that the book draws from his personal experiences and is therefore highly biased, so just keep that in mind while reading it.
