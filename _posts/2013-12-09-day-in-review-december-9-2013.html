On a brief detour from the dojo dashboard, Phil and I worked on 8th Light's customized Boucher configurations. There were hardcoded average-request-per-second and burst-limits for the webserver that our stakeholder wanted to be able to configure programmatically.<br /><br />After some digging around, we figured out where Boucher was creating the nginx configuration files. From there it was simply a matter of turning the hard-coded values into variables.<br /><br />To me, this story really highlighted the confidence and problem-solving skills I've gained from my time at 8th Light. Getting started, I knew very little about nginx, Chef, and Boucher, but Phil and I were quickly able to analyze which parts of these technologies were relevant to the problem at hand and swiftly find a solution we were comfortable with.
