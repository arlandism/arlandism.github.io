I've been reading through Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices and I've just gotten to the Payroll case study where Uncle Bob will be highlighting several design patterns and their applicability in the real-world. First up we have the Command pattern.<br /><br />So, let's start off with an interface. I should also note that this "interface" is just for show. I'll be using Ruby so there's no need for explicit interface implementation.<br /><br /><br /><pre class="brush:ruby" name="code">class Command<br /><br />  def do<br />  end<br /><br />end<br /></pre><br />Well that wasn't very complex. In the wild, the pattern is used when it's necessary to implement some "undo" functionality.
