I'm really enjoying my Java right now. Fortunately, I'm reading "<i>Refactoring" </i>right now which, to me, is beginning to imply that unless a system's design is absolutely terrible it can probably be refactored. This has vast implications in my day-to-day workflow since I worry less about decisions I make in the heat of the moment.<br /><br />This is a bit of a double-edged sword though, since reminding myself that I can always come back to some rotten code makes writing the code more palatable. It's important to keep this attitude in check since in the real world, those "I'll come back to it" moments probably happen pretty frequently, while the "I'm back" moments probably happen very rarely.<br /><br /><br /><ul></ul>
