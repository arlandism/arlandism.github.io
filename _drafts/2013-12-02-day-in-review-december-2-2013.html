<b>SCNA Videos</b><br /><b><br /></b>Today, I worked mostly on video editing and the backend for the SCNA website. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the website was built with Clojure technologies. This made it relatively straightforward to dig around and figure out how things were working. I just needed to make a clone of the media page for this year's SCNA videos. I submitted a pull request for the changes I made and hopefully everything checks out.<br /><br /><b>Clojure Compiler</b><br /><b><br /></b>I found out Myles was working on a Clojure -&gt; LLVM compiler as a Waza project and asked him how I could get involved. I've been looking to get my hands dirty with a compiler for a while now and this seemed like the perfect time to take the plunge. The primary advantage of the compiler, assuming we get it working, will be speed. Instead of having to boot the JVM and run Java bytecode, we would have executable machine code.
